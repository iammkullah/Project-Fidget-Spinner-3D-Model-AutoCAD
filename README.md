# Project-Fidget-Spinner-3D-Model-AutoCAD
This repository will provide you the overview about the 3D modal of the fidget spinner. A fidget spinner is a toy that consists of a ball bearing in the center of a multi-lobed (typically two or three) flat structure made from metal or plastic designed to spin along its axis with very little effort. A person holds the center pad while the toy spins. They are made from various materials including brass, stainless steel, titanium, copper, aluminum, and plastic. The software we used for the model is AutoCAD. The objectives of the project are (1) to get familiar with the 3D interference of the AutoCAD, (2) to increase the productivity of the designer, (3) to improve the quality of design. Following are the 3 main things we follow to create our desire model of fidget spinner.
